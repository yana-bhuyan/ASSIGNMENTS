# Observations

Conditional statements such as if, elif, and else were used to implement decision-making in Python.

Relational and logical operators were applied to compare values and evaluate conditions.

Programs demonstrated different real-life decision problems such as divisibility checks, finding the greatest number, leap year verification, and grading system.

Multiple conditions were handled efficiently using nested and chained conditional statements.

The math module was used for solving quadratic equations.

Python executes only the block of code whose condition evaluates to true.

Overall Result

All programs based on conditional statements executed successfully.

The correct output was obtained for each condition tested.

The experiment helped in understanding decision-making using conditional statements in Python.

The aim of the experiment was achieved.
